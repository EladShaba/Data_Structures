In this code, we will use the avl tree data structure to implement a list.
The code is written in python.

| Data Structure | Insert/delete at  the middle   | Insert/delete at the end | Retrieve at middle  |
| :-----: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Array (Python List) | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(1)   | O(1)   |
| Linked List | O(1)   | O(n)   | O(1)   | O(n)   |
| AVL Tree | O(log n)   | O(log n)   | O(log n)   | O(log n)   |

While those are the Asymptotic bounds, of course native list of python will have better performance.
